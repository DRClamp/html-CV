    <p>I recently worked as a maintenance operative/electrician at a well renowned holiday park which allowed me to complete the level 3(2365) for electrical installations, and am now hoping to find suitable employment that will allow me to finish the NVQ and become a fully qualified electrician.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Experienced in electrical maintenance and installations often with a contracted qualified electrician. With both a domestic(lodges) and commercial/industrial(restaurant ,play center and leisure center) aspect which was advantageous.  I have good dexterity with tools and working at height in a safe manner.
        I am well organized and work to a clean standard. I have a broad knowledge of various trades. Often dealing with customers in a polite and well-spoken manner.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I feel I have a lot to offer as I value continued growth and am hard working. I understand what it takes to be a good employee and an asset to a company.
        Able to work away as I have no family obligations and have experience in doing so. I possess a full clean driving license and DBS check.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Personally, I enjoy playing guitar and enjoy keeping fit.
        If you have any questions, please contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.
